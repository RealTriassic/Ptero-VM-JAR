# ⚠️ Maintenance Notice
This project is no longer maintained and has been superceded by [Harbor](https://github.com/RealTriassic/Harbor), please use that instead as it is a lot better, has a smaller footprint and simply just runs a lot better. It includes wrappers for Python, Javascript (NodeJS) and Java (Kotlin) and supports both `x86_64` and `AARCH64` CPU architectures. Thank you for your continued support and I hope to see you there.
